# Realplay
Repository for the game-mode I developed for the Zest Roleplay server for San-Andreas Multiplayer. 

Included is the gamemode itself, as well as the NPC instructions I made, and are required for in-game events. There is also an example account generated by the scripts, as well as filterscripts which will allow you to enable and disable various functionality depending on your needs.

This also contains the includes necessary for PAWNO, in order to make further additions to the script.
